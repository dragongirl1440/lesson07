### Current Issues

Unable to import any MUI icons due to an error where hooks are repeatedly called, React enters an endless loop, and the screen goes white.  Cause is unknown.

Added an option to mute or unmute using the record player, as the video source used is better with music.  Implementation failed due to a mishap with nested functions.

Footer text is obtrusive and gets in the way of video text.

Author of video used is unknown and has been difficult to locate since video was found and hosted on Discord.

Video may sometimes download as a file instead of playing as an embed due to specifications in the header.  Issue is fixed locally, but is unknown if it is fixed for local hosting on other computers or on servers.
